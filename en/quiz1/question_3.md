legend: Question 3 of 3

Your project is not working. What should you do?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Panic!

  --- feedback ---

  That's not going to help. You need to think clearly to fix coding problems.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Give up

  --- feedback ---

  There are lots of things you could try. Great coders often get things wrong the first time and learn a lot from their mistakes.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Read the code carefully and try to debug it.

  --- feedback ---

  Yes. Fixing bugs is part of coding. The more you practise the more experience you get, and the easier it becomes to find and fix bugs. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Get annoyed with the computer

  --- feedback ---

A computer only does what we tell it to do, so getting annoyed with it isn't logical. 

Being annoyed won't help to solve the problem, as it will make it harder to think clearly.

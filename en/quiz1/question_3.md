Jay's project is not working. What should they do?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Panic!

  --- feedback ---

  That's not going to help. You need to think clearly to fix coding problems.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Give up

  --- feedback ---

  There are lots of things Jay could try. Great coders often get things wrong the first time and learn a lot from their mistakes.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Read the code carefully and try to debug it. 

  --- feedback ---

  Yes. Fixing bugs is part of coding. The more you practice the more experience you get and the easier it becomes to find and fix bugs. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Get annoyed with the computer.

  --- feedback ---

A computer only does what we tell them to do so getting annoyed with it isn't logical. 

Being annoyed won't help to solve the problem as it will make it harder to think clearly.

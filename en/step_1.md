## Introduction

You will make a first-person view project where the player is a customer. The customer will be able to buy items from your shop.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**First-person view**</span> means that you don't see your character on the screen, instead you see what they see.
</p>

You will:
+ Create a business simulation with in-game rewards.
+ Think of an original design idea to create your project.
+ Plan your time to get a simple version working quickly.

### Try it 

Click on Space Fruit to buy them and watch the total go up. When you're ready, clik on Kiran to checkout. 

What happens if you try to checkout before you have chosen any fruit? How do you think the project knows that you haven't added any fruit yet?

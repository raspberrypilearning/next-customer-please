## You will make

Make a shop app where the customer can buy items from your shop. The project will be in first-person view where the player is a customer. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**First-person view**</span> means that you don't see your character on the screen, instead you see what they see.
</p>

You will:
+ Create a shop app with items to buy and a checkout
+ Plan your time to get a simple version working quickly
+ Try shops made by others and share your shop so others can try it

## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- add more items to sell
- add more graphic and sound effects
- paint your own scenery and other costumes
- make another business and allow players to visit them both

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.

Take a look at our ['Intergalactic shopping market'](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29662180){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio to see projects created by community members.

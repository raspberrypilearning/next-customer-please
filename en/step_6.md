## Share

If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends?

If you are logged in on Scratch you can create a studio and add your **Next customer please!** project. You can also add your friend's **Next customer please!** projects to create a mall of different shops and businesses.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.

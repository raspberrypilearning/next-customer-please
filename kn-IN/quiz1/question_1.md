## Reflection

Well done, you used your skills to design and build a shop app!

You used `Events`{:class="block3events"}, `Control`{:class="block3control"}, `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"}, `Operators`{:class="block3operators"}, `Variables`{:class="block3variables"}, `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks!

Now it's time to reflect â€” reflecting is an important part of learning because it helps make new connections in your brain.

Answer the three questions below to reflect on what you've learned.

legend: Question 1 of 3

A shop project uses a `total`{:class="block3variables"} variable to store the total for each customer.

+ A customer adds items that total `50` and pays
+ A new customer adds items that total `40` but the `total`{:class="block3variables"} is now showing as `90` for the second customer

Which block would you need to add to the payment script to make the total go back to `0` when each customer pays?

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
ask [Would you like to pay or cancel?] and wait
if {(answer) = [pay]} then
say (join [That will be ] (total)) for (2) seconds
play sound [coin v] until done 
say (join [Thanks for shopping at ] (name)) for (2) seconds
broadcast [next customer v]
end
```

Not quite, `total`{:class="block3variables"} should be `0` after a customer pays, but it is not the `change`{:class="block3variables"} block you need.

 --- /feedback ---

- ( )
```blocks3
set [total v] to [40]
```

 --- feedback ---

 Not quite, this would work for the second customer but the `total`{:class="block3variables"} would be wrong for other customers.

- (x)

```blocks3
set [total v] to [0]
```

 --- feedback ---

Yes, that's correct. You need to `set`{:class="block3variables"} the `total`{:class="block3variables"} to `0` after each customer pays.

 --- /feedback ---

- ( )

```blocks3
change [total v] by [-50]
```

 --- feedback ---

That would work for this example, but what if the first customer spent a different amount? Your solution needs to work when the previous customer spends different amounts.
